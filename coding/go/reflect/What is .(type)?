In Go, the expression x.(type) is used within a type switch to perform a type assertion and obtain the dynamic type of the value stored in the interface variable x. This is a special syntax that can only be used inside a switch statement that is specifically designed for type switching.

func printType(x interface{}) {
    switch value := x.(type) {
    case int:
        fmt.Println("Integer:", value)
    case string:
        fmt.Println("String:", value)
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unknown Type")
    }
}
