Use a lightweight framework. A lightweight framework will help to reduce the overhead of your API and improve its performance. Some popular lightweight Golang frameworks include Gin, Echo, and Fiber.
Choose the right data structures. Efficient data structures can make a big difference in the performance of your API. For example, using a hash table instead of a linked list for storing data can significantly improve performance for certain operations.
Use caching. Caching can help to reduce the number of requests that your API needs to make to the database or other backend services. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of time that your API spends waiting for responses.
Use asynchronous processing. Asynchronous processing can help to improve the performance of your API by allowing it to handle multiple requests at the same time. Golang's goroutines and channels make it easy to implement asynchronous processing in your APIs.
Monitor and profile your API. It is important to monitor and profile your API to identify areas where performance can be improved. There are a number of tools available to help you do this, such as Prometheus and Grafana.
