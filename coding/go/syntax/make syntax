Syntax of make
The make function can have different parameters based on what it is initializing:

Slices: make([]Type, length, [capacity])

Type is the element type of the slice.
length is the initial length of the slice (the number of elements it contains).
capacity (optional) is the total size of the underlying array. If omitted, the capacity is set to the length. Specifying a capacity can be more efficient when you know you'll be adding many elements to the slice because it minimizes the number of reallocations required as the slice grows.
Maps: make(map[KeyType]ValueType, [initialCapacity])

KeyType is the type of the map keys.
ValueType is the type of the map values.
initialCapacity (optional) is a hint about the number of elements that will be added to the map. It's not a limit, and the map can grow beyond this size.
Channels: make(chan Type, [bufferSize])

Type is the type of the elements that the channel can transport.
bufferSize (optional) specifies the size of the channel's buffer. A bufferSize of 0 (or omitted) creates an unbuffered channel, while specifying a size creates a buffered channel.
