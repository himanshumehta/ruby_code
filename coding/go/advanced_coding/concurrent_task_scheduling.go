Concurrent Task Scheduling:

// Wrong Approach: Implementing custom task scheduling with goroutines without considering the system's concurrency limits, leading to resource exhaustion.
for _, task := range tasks {
    go task.Execute()
}

// Right Approach: Using a worker pool or a task scheduling library to limit the number of concurrently running tasks and manage system resources efficiently.
var wg sync.WaitGroup
for _, task := range tasks {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(t Task) {
        t.Execute()
        wg.Done()
    }(task)
}
wg.Wait()
