Resource Cleanup:
// Wrong Approach: Neglecting to release resources like file handles, database connections, or network connections, leading to resource leaks.
// ... open a file or database connection
// ... operations with the resource

// Right Approach: Defer the release of resources and use appropriate cleanup methods to ensure timely and proper resource release.
// ... open a file or database connection
defer func() {
    // close the file or release the connection
}()
// ... operations with the resource
