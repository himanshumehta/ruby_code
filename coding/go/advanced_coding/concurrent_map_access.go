Concurrent Map Access:
// Wrong Approach: Accessing a map concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to potential race conditions.
var m = make(map[string]int)

// ... concurrent access to m
// Right Approach: Using the sync package or sync.Map for safe concurrent access to maps.
var m sync.Map
// ... concurrent access to m
