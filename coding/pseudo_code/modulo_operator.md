**Modulo operator**
Whenever the second number is larger than the first, 
the second number will divide the first 0 times, so the first number will be the remainder.
p 7 % 8
##### >> 7
The modulus operator can also work with negative operands. x % y always returns results with the sign of y.
p -6 % 4
##### >> 2
p 6 % -4
##### >> -2
