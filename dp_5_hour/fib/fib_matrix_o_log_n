Base Matrix for Fibonacci Computation: The matrix 
[
	[1, 1]
	[1, 0]
]

is the foundation. When powered to n-1, its top left element gives the nth Fibonacci number.

Matrix Exponentiation: The code efficiently computes powers of this base matrix using recursion and squaring, which is much faster than naive multiplication.

Extracting the Fibonacci Number: The nth Fibonacci number is retrieved from the powered matrix, demonstrating the power of matrix operations in solving algorithmic problems efficiently.

This approach is vastly more efficient than iterative or simple recursive methods for large n, offering a time complexity of O(log n) due to the exponentiation by squaring method.


Code 

def multiply_matrices(a, b)
  result = Array.new(2) { Array.new(2, 0) }
  
  (0..1).each do |i|
    (0..1).each do |j|
      (0..1).each do |k|
        result[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]
      end
    end
  end
  result
end

def matrix_power(matrix, n)
  return matrix if n == 1
  temp = matrix_power(matrix, n / 2)
  temp = multiply_matrices(temp, temp)
  
  return temp if n.even?
  multiply_matrices(temp, matrix)
end

def fib_matrix_exponentiation(n)
  base = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
  return 0 if n == 0
  return 1 if n == 1  # Handle case when n == 1
  power = matrix_power(base, n - 1)
  power[0][0]
end

puts fib_matrix_exponentiation(5)  # Correct output should be 55, not 8.
