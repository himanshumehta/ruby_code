Explain problem statement and share ruby code solution from non optimised to most optimised and explanation

Two Sum Core logic: Use a hash map to store complement values. - Solved

Valid Anagram Core logic: Compare character frequency counts. - Solved

Group Anagrams Core logic: Use sorted strings as hash map keys.

Explain problem statement and share ruby code solution from non optimised to most optimised and explanation
Top K Frequent Elements Core logic: Use a hash map and bucket sort.

Product of Array Except Self Core logic: Use prefix and suffix products.

Longest Consecutive Sequence Core logic: Use a hash set for O(1) lookups.

Subarray Sum Equals K Core logic: Use cumulative sum and a hash map.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters Core logic: Sliding window with a hash map.

Minimum Window Substring Core logic: Sliding window with two hash maps.

Find All Anagrams in a String Core logic: Sliding window with character frequency counts.

LRU Cache Core logic: Combine hash map and doubly linked list.

Merge Intervals Core logic: Sort intervals and merge overlapping ones.

Insert Interval Core logic: Iterate and handle three cases (before, overlap, after).

Set Matrix Zeroes Core logic: Use first row and column as markers.

Spiral Matrix Core logic: Simulate the spiral traversal with boundaries.
